    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
    <p>
        Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances.To answer your question,my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
    </p> 
    <p>
        Polynesian chicken dance <br>

        <p class="suojin">
            A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance aroundin a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful" .
        </p>

        Icelandic brownian shuffle <br>
 
        &emsp;&emsp;Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, whichinvolved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffing their bodies around in imperceptiblytiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspiredmodern styles such as Twerking.
 
       
        <br> Arctic robot dance <br>
       &emsp;&emsp;An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have
       discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic" , stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitantsof Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like thisbecause they were really cold.
